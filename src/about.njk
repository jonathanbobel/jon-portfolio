      <p class="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed">I design and code intuitive interfaces that make the web more accessible and enjoyable for everyone. My passion for human-centered design comes from being an outgoing, empathetic person—I want to create experiences that work for people of all abilities.</p>

      <p class="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed">I’ve always been drawn to the intersection of art and technology, which led me to a career in UI design and front-end development. Whether I’m crafting seamless digital experiences or advocating for accessibility, my goal is always to simplify complexity and make technology more inclusive.</p>

      <p class="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed">Outside of work, I’m a proud toddler dad, which means a lot of my time is spent chasing after my little one. When I’m not at the keyboard, you’ll probably find me cycling, hiking, snowboarding, or camping—anything that gets me outdoors. I’m deeply involved in local cycling advocacy, working to make biking safer and more accessible for everyone. I also love watching sports, swimming, and just being in nature.</p>

      <p class="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed">Born outside of Chicago, raised in Delaware, and having spent time in China, I’ve called Cleveland, Ohio home for quite a while now. I’m easy to laugh, always encouraging others to do the same, and I bring that same energy into my work—because good design should be clear, accessible, and maybe! even a little fun.</p>
