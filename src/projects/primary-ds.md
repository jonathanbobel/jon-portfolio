## Overview
Primary is a modular design system I originally built to support a large-scale enterprise design and development team. While the original version was created during my time at a Fortune 500 company, this iteration strips away proprietary branding to focus on reusable components, accessibility, and a scalable visual language.

## Responsibilities
- Served as Lead Developer in the creation of an internal design system at a Fortune 500 company
- Built the system using React, with a focus on reusable components and scalable architecture
- Collaborated closely with the Lead Designer to define and realize the systemâ€™s vision
- Engaged stakeholders across departments to gather feedback, present concepts, and ensure cross-functional alignment
- Piloted the system on a live product team to integrate Primary into real-world workflows
- Published and maintained the system as an internal npm package for easy adoption across teams
