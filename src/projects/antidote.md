## Overview
Partnered with my wife Lara Bobel on a project for a local massage therapist. Leaning heavily on Gray's Anatomy (the anatomy book, not TV show) to drive the branding, creating an engaging parralax SPA to showcase the treatements and therapists at Antidote. 

## Responsibilities
- Utilized **skrollr.js** to assist with creating a parralax experience 
- Site was originally written in Angular
